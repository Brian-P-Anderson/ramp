I would like to use the excellent YelpCamp example to build a template for
node apps that I can use to lift up small websites for people. I would like
this template to use polka instead of express, semantic UI instead of bootstrap,
no more ejs, redis in place of mongodb, and I want it to support I18n and L10n.
For starters...
